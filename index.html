    <h1>HTML Concepts</h1>

      <b>How the Web Works</b>
      <p>
        The web functions thanks to communication of many computers. When I log onto www.udacity.com, my computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a server. <em>HTTP</em> stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The server locates the corresponding HTML document and sends it back to my computer where my browser interprets the web page and displays it on my screen.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/NBI9kXzMHS0">This video</a> explains this concept.

      <b>HTML</b>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents make up most of the content that is found on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text conent</em> which describes what someone sees and <em>markup</em>, which describes how something looks.

      <b>Tags and Elements</b>
      <p>
        HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When we compose an
        HTML document, we are telling the browser the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.

      <b>Are Computers are Stupid?</b>
      <p>
        Computers are not necessarily stupid but they do take anything stated
        literally. This means ambiguity from the programmer, in any measure,
        can cause many issues at a later time.

      <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
      <p>
        HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements
        form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Inline elements are placed on the same line as any text next to it.

      <b>Span vs Div Elements</b>
      <p>
        Note:
        Span is an inline element. Div is a block element.

      <b>Document Structure</b>
      <p>
        The &lt; !DOCTYPE html &gt; tag should always be at the top of the page. The other tags reqired are the &lt;html&gt, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt; and &lt;body&gt;,
